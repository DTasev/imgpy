For creating a production docker image an account should be added to prevent using root for everything by default.

This can be accomplished by adding the following lines in the Dockerfile.

```
# Set up a user `developer` with sudo rights
RUN export uid=1000 gid=1000 && \
    mkdir -p /home/developer && \
    mkdir -p /etc/sudoers.d/ && \
    echo "developer:x:${uid}:${gid}:Developer,,,:/home/developer:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd && \
    echo "developer:x:${uid}:" >> /etc/group && \
    echo "developer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/developer && \
    chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/developer && \
    chown ${uid}:${gid} -R /home/developer

USER developer
ENV HOME /home/developer
```
