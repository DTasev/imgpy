Jupyter Notebooks Tutorial
==========================

There are 2 Jupyter Notebooks that show off how the package works. They require
having a working setup of `mantidimaging` in the `~/mantidimaging` directory.
Easiest way to do that would be to do a `git clone
https://github.com/mantidproject/mantidimaging` while in the Home (`~`)
directory. The paths are being setup inside the notebook at runtime, usually in
the first few blocks of code.

The notebook files are located in `mantidimaging/notebooks` folder. They require
that `Jupyter Notebook` is installed, which should be, if using Anaconda's
python distrubution. To start a notebook go into the `mantidimaging/notebooks`
directory and run with `jupyter notebook`. This will start a local server and
will open the notebook in the browser.

They are a brief introduction to the steps in a reconstruction, and explain some
of the terms. However they were used during a presentation, so some things might
be missing as text.
