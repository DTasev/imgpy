Running the tests
=================

To run the tests the :code:`nose` package should be used. It will automatically find files that start or end with :code:`_test.py` and run them.

In the :code:`mantidimaging` sub-directory, type :code:`make test` to run them.
This is the folder that forms the :code:`mantidimaging` package and contains the :code:`main.py` and :code:`__main__.py` files.
