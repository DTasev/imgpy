Colour Palette
==============

The colour palette of an image can be changed by right clicking its histogram.
This allows users to choose from a number of pre-defined gradients.

Automatic Gradient Tweeking
---------------------------

Users can also use the Jenks Breaks or Otsu algorithms to automatically change the appearance
of the gradient. In the case of Jenks, this can be done based on a number of materials
provided by the user. The software will then attempt to categorise the image into groups
and select colours that emphasise the contrast between the different regions of the image. In s
ome cases, this may make the different materials in the image more easy to distinguish from
one another. Users should bear in mind that the result depends a great deal on the success of
Jenks/Otsu and the colour scheme chosen.

This feature can be accessed by right clicking the histogram and selecting "Auto," as
shown below:
