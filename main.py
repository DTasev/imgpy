"""
Do a tomographic reconstruction, including:
- Pre-processing of input raw images,
- 3d volume reconstruction using a third party tomographic reconstruction tool
- Post-processing of reconstructed volume
- Saving reconstruction results (and pre-processing results, and self-save this script and subpackages)

This command line script and the classes and packages that it uses are prepared so that
they can be run from Mantid, locally (as a process) or remotely (through the tomographic reconstruction
GUI remote job submission, or the remote algorithms).

Example command lines:

python tomo_reconstruct.py --help
